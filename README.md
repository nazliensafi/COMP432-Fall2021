The files for the specific parts of the project are in the specific folders, namely Classifiers, Classifier Interpretibility, and Regression.
Please browse to the directories and run the .ipynb files respective to the topic. For the report, please refer to report.pdf in the root directory.


Running Part 3:
-For running the CNN, sequentially load all the necessary methods. 
-You can run the 'run_cnn' blocks to watch the training of the base and augmented data models, but the files for the trained models are included (to avoid long training times) 
- eval_model blocks will load the 30 model files and calculate the scores before plotting. This can take approximately 30 minutes.
- please be patient :).

Thanks,

Group 23
