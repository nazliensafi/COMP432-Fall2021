Compare the performance of 8 regressors across 8 regression datasets.

Regression models
You should evaluate the following 8 regression models:

Linear regression
Support vector regression
Decision tree regression
Random forest regression
kk-nearest neighbours regression
AdaBoost regression
Gaussian process regression
Neural network regression
Again, each is provided by scikit-learn with a unified interface: MLPRegressor, SVR, AdaBoostRegressor, etc. The only new one is GaussianProcessRegressor (unrelated to Gaussian naive Bayes).

Regression datasets
Evaluate each of the above regression models on each of the following the UCI repository:

Wine Quality
Communities and Crime
QSAR aquatic toxicity
Facebook metrics
Bike Sharing (use hour data)
Student Performance (use just student-por.csv if you do not know how to merge the math grades)
Concrete Compressive Strength
SGEMM GPU kernel performance (predict how fast two matrices can be multiplied by a GPU)
